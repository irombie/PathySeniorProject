# Pathy: Turkish Twitter Sentiment Analysis Platform. 

## Overview of Pathy and its achievements

Pathy is our senior project for graduation from the Computer Science Department of Bilkent University. It is a sentiment analysis platfrom in Turkish, which aids professionals/companies in gaining insight about the engagement between their products/events and the public. Specifically, the customers of Pathy can just type in a hashtag they would like to gain insight about, perhaps created for a company event or a product and learn about how the public reacted to this event/product.

Sentiment analysis in Turkish had not been studied in depth and it was perceived to be a challenging task. On the other hand, after our discussions with several CEOs, we identified that there was a need for such a tool in the market. That led to Pathy being a highly praised senior project and receiving The Innovation Award.
